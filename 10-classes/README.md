## Classes and Objects

Classes and Objects are used to to make your code more efficient and less repetitive by grouping similar tasks.
Class member variables are called "properties". You may also see them referred to using other terms such as "attributes" or "fields".

They are defined by using one of the keywords **public**, **protected**, or **private**, followed by a normal variable declaration. 

##### Constract and Destruct
Classes which have a constructor method call this method on each newly-created object.
The destructor method will be called as soon as there are no other references to a particular object, or in any order during the shutdown sequence.

##### Visibility
**public**, **protected** or **private**

##### Abstract

##### Interface
Object interfaces allow you to create code which specifies which methods a class must implement, without having to define how these methods are implemented.

##### Traits
Traits are a mechanism for code reuse in single inheritance languages such as PHP. A Trait is intended to reduce some limitations of single inheritance by enabling a developer to reuse sets of methods freely in several independent classes living in different class hierarchies.
